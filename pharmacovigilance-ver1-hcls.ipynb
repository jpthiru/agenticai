It's a critical function for pharmaceutical companies to ensure patient safety and maintain regulatory compliance.  It involves collecting reports of adverse events (side effects) associated with their drugs, analyzing the data, and taking action if necessary (e.g., updating labeling, issuing warnings, or even withdrawing a drug from the market).\n","*   **Key Challenges in Pharmacovigilance:**\n","    *   **Volume of Data:**  Massive amounts of data come from various sources: clinical trials, spontaneous reports from patients and healthcare professionals, social media, scientific literature, and more.\n","    *   **Data Heterogeneity:**  Data is unstructured (narrative text in reports, social media posts) and structured (database fields).\n","    *   **Signal Detection:**  Identifying early warning signs of potential safety issues amidst the noise.\n","    *   **Causality Assessment:**  Determining if a drug actually *caused* an adverse event.\n","    *   **Regulatory Reporting:**  Meeting stringent and evolving regulatory requirements.\n","    *   **Resource Intensive:** Pharmacovigilance is a labor-intensive and costly process.\n","\n","**How AI Can Help (General Use Cases)**\n","\n","AI can address many of these challenges by:\n","\n","*   **Automating Data Collection and Processing:**\n","    *   **Natural Language Processing (NLP):**  Extracting relevant information (drug names, adverse events, patient characteristics, etc.) from unstructured text sources (e.g., adverse event reports, medical literature, social media).  This significantly reduces manual review time.\n","    *   **Optical Character Recognition (OCR):**  Converting scanned documents (e.g., handwritten reports) into machine-readable text.\n","    *   **Data Integration:**  Combining data from disparate sources into a unified database.\n","*   **Improving Signal Detection:**\n","    *   **Machine Learning (ML):**  Identifying patterns and anomalies in adverse event data that might indicate a safety signal.  This can help detect potential problems earlier than traditional methods.\n","    *   **Statistical Analysis:**  Analyzing trends and correlations to identify potential drug-event associations.\n","*   **Enhancing Causality Assessment:**\n","    *   **AI-powered tools:** Help assess the likelihood that a drug caused a specific adverse event by analysing patient history, concomitant medications, and the timing of events.\n","*   **Automating Report Generation and Submission:**\n","    *   **Robotic Process Automation (RPA):**  Automating the process of creating and submitting regulatory reports.\n","*   **Risk Stratification:**\n","    *   **Predicting Risk:** Identifying patient populations that may be at higher risk for adverse events based on their characteristics and medical history.\n","*   **Literature Monitoring:**\n","    *   **AI-driven literature review:** Automatically scanning scientific publications to identify potential safety concerns.\n","\n","**Specific Use Cases for Pfizer and AbbVie**\n","\n","While I don't have access to their internal strategies, here are *potential* use cases, considering their product portfolios and priorities:\n","\n","*   **Pfizer:**\n","    *   **COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring:**  Given the scale of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, Pfizer could use AI to monitor adverse event reports from around the world, identify potential safety signals, and ensure the vaccine's continued safety.  This would be critical for public trust.\n","    *   **Oncology Drug Safety:**  Pfizer has a significant oncology portfolio.  AI could be used to identify rare or unexpected adverse events associated with cancer drugs, particularly in specific patient subgroups.  This is crucial because cancer patients often have complex medical histories and are taking multiple medications.\n","    *   **Biosimilar Pharmacovigilance:**  As biosimilars become more prevalent, Pfizer (or its biosimilar division) could use AI to compare the safety profiles of biosimilars to their reference products.\n","*   **AbbVie:**\n","    *   **Humira and Immunology Drug Safety:**  Humira (adalimumab) is a blockbuster immunology drug.  AbbVie could use AI to monitor adverse events associated with Humira and other immunology drugs, particularly those related to autoimmune diseases and infections.  This is important because these drugs can suppress the immune system.\n","    *   **Neuroscience Drug Safety:**  AbbVie has a growing neuroscience portfolio.  AI could be used to identify potential safety issues associated with drugs for neurological conditions, such as migraines and Parkinson's disease.\n","    *   **Post-Market Surveillance for New Drugs:**  For newly launched drugs, AI can accelerate the identification of previously unknown adverse events by analyzing real-world data.\n","\n","**How a Pfizer/ABBVIE AI Solution Might Work**\n","\n","1.  **Data Ingestion:**  The system would ingest data from multiple sources:\n","    *   Global safety databases (e.g., EudraVigilance [Europe], FAERS [US])\n","    *   Internal adverse event reporting systems\n","    *   Electronic health records (EHRs) (if access is available and compliant with privacy regulations)\n","    *   Social media (with appropriate safeguards and ethical considerations)\n","    *   Medical literature databases (e.g., PubMed)\n","\n","2.  **Data Preprocessing:**  The data would be cleaned, standardized, and transformed into a usable format.  This includes:\n","    *   NLP for extracting information from unstructured text\n","    *   Data deduplication\n","    *   Data validation\n","\n","3.  **AI Modeling:**  Machine learning models would be trained to:\n","    *   Identify potential safety signals\n","    *   Predict the likelihood of adverse events\n","    *   Assess causality\n","    *   Stratify patient risk\n","\n","4.  **Alerting and Reporting:**  The system would generate alerts when potential safety signals are detected.  It would also automate the generation of regulatory reports.\n","\n","5.  **Human Review:**  AI is not a replacement for human expertise.  Alerts and reports would be reviewed by trained pharmacovigilance professionals to confirm the findings and take appropriate action.\n","\n","**Important Considerations:**\n","\n","*   **Data Privacy and Security:**  Protecting patient data is paramount.  AI systems must be designed to comply with all relevant privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).\n","*   **Bias Mitigation:**  AI models can be biased if they are trained on biased data.  It's important to carefully evaluate and mitigate potential biases.\n","*   **Explainability:**  Understanding *why* an AI model made a particular prediction is important for building trust and ensuring accountability.\n","*   **Regulatory Acceptance:**  Pharmaceutical companies need to work with regulatory agencies to ensure that AI-powered pharmacovigilance systems are accepted and validated.\n","\n","**In Conclusion:**\n","\n","AI has the potential to transform pharmacovigilance, making it more efficient, accurate, and proactive.  Pfizer and AbbVie, like other major pharmaceutical companies, are likely investing in AI solutions to improve their pharmacovigilance capabilities. Specific use cases would depend on their product portfolios, strategic priorities, and risk tolerance.  The success of these initiatives will depend on careful planning, data quality, robust AI models, and a strong commitment to data privacy and regulatory compliance.\n","\n","Gemini model '('gemini-2.0-flash-001',)' initialized.\n","Google Embedding model 'models/text-embedding-004' ready via ChromaDB helper.\n"]}],"source":["# import google.generativeai as genai2\n","client = None\n","try:\n","    client = genai.Client(api_key=google_client)\n","    # Using Flash for speed, consider Pro for more complex reasoning\n","    model_name=\"gemini-2.0-flash-001\",\n","    response = client.models.generate_content(\n","        model=\"gemini-2.0-flash-001\",\n","        contents=\"Will this pfizer or abbvie solve any of their use cases with Pharmacovigilance\",\n","        # config = generation_config,\n","        config = types.GenerateContentConfig(\n","            temperature = 0.7, # Adjust for creativity vs consistency\n","            top_p= 1.0,\n","            top_k= 32,\n","            max_output_tokens= 8192,\n","            safety_settings=[\n","            types.SafetySetting(\n","                category=types.HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH,\n","                threshold=types.HarmBlockThreshold.BLOCK_LOW_AND_ABOVE,\n","            ),]\n","        )\n","        # safetySettings = safety_settings\n","    )\n","    print(response.text)\n","    print(f\"Gemini model '{model_name}' initialized.\")\n","\n","    # Using Google's text embedding model via the Generative AI SDK\n","    embedding_model_name = \"models/text-embedding-004\"\n","    # Note: Direct embedding function via genai SDK might be simpler for some use cases\n","    # Or use ChromaDB's helper with GoogleGenerativeAiEmbeddingFunction if needed\n","    google_ef = embedding_functions.GoogleGenerativeAiEmbeddingFunction(api_key=google_client, model_name=embedding_model_name)\n","    print(f\"Google Embedding model '{embedding_model_name}' ready via ChromaDB helper.\")\n","\n","except Exception as e:\n","    print(f\"Error initializing Google AI services: {e}\")\n","    # Handle error appropriately (e.g., exit or fallback)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"b290bb54","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.012993,"end_time":"2025-04-17T16:33:54.7791","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-04-17T16:33:54.766107","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["### Helper function for LLM calls"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":12,"id":"2156bbef","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-17T16:33:54.806791Z","iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-17T16:33:54.806408Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-17T16:33:54.814253Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-17T16:33:54.813131Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.023657,"end_time":"2025-04-17T16:33:54.816217","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-04-17T16:33:54.79256","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["def call_gemini(prompt, llm_model=client, is_json_output=False):\n","    \"\"\"Sends a prompt to the Gemini model and returns the text response.\"\"\"\n","    try:\n","        client = genai.Client(api_key=google_client)\n","        # model_name=\"gemini-2.0-flash-001\",\n","        # Add instruction for JSON output if requested\n","        if is_json_output:\n","             prompt += \"\\n\\nPlease format your response strictly as a JSON object.\"\n","\n","        response = client.models.generate_content(\n","            model = \"gemini-2.0-flash\",\n","            contents = prompt,\n","            # config=generation_config,\n","            # safetySettings=safety_settings\n","            config = types.GenerateContentConfig(\n","                temperature = 0.7, # Adjust for creativity vs consistency\n","                top_p= 1.0,\n","                top_k= 32,\n","                max_output_tokens= 8192,\n","                safety_settings=[\n","                types.SafetySetting(\n","                    category=types.HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH,\n","                    threshold=types.HarmBlockThreshold.BLOCK_LOW_AND_ABOVE,\n","                )]\n","            )\n","        )\n","        # Basic check for blocked content\n","        if not response.candidates:\n","             print(\"Warning: Response was blocked or empty.\")\n","             return None\n","        # Attempt to extract text, handle potential errors\n","        try:\n","            result_text = response.text\n","            if is_json_output:\n","                # Clean potential markdown ```json ... ```\n","                result_text = re.sub(r'^```json\\s*|\\s*```$', '', result_text, flags=re.MULTILINE)\n","                return json.loads(result_text) # Parse JSON\n","            return result_text\n","        except (ValueError, json.JSONDecodeError) as json_err:\n","             print(f\"Warning: Could not parse expected JSON output.
